/**
 * Match-3-6
 * The "Polish" Update
 *
 * Original Lua by: Colton Ogden (cogden@cs50.harvard.edu)
 * Adapted to JS by: Vikram Singh (vikram.singh@johnabbott.qc.ca)
 *
 * Match-3 has taken several forms over the years, with its roots in games
 * like Tetris in the 80s. Bejeweled, in 2001, is probably the most recognized
 * version of this game, as well as Candy Crush from 2012, though all these
 * games owe Shariki, a DOS game from 1994, for their inspiration.
 * The goal of the game is to match any three tiles of the same pattern by
 * swapping any two adjacent tiles; when three or more tiles match in a line,
 * those tiles add to the player's score and are removed from play, with new
 * tiles coming from the ceiling to replace them.
 *
 * As per previous projects, we'll be adopting a retro, NES-quality aesthetic.
